Hi guys, if you're reading this then you're in the right place for the Skynet Android project!  

At the next meeting on Thursday we can begin making some kind of project outline and do some kind of android tutorial for those who are unfamiliar with android programming. 

I think that we should all stick to the same IDE in order to keep work in sync so I'd advise everyone download the Android Studio SDK from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html  
For now I would have a look at the Android tutorials at: http://developer.android.com/training/index.html  

If I had to give some (vague) advice to those who want to start now:
If it's your first time looking at Android but you're familiar with Java then I'd advise to look at how intentions work, and how GUIs and Listeners work in Android. 
If you're unfamiliar with Java then look at the HelloWorld example that android provides and try to become familiar with the structure of an android programme.

Have fun learning android and being part of the team!
