Hi guys, if you're reading this then you're in the right place for the Skynet Application project!  

At the next meeting on Thursday we can begin making some kind of project outline and do some kind of android tutorial for those who are unfamiliar with android programming. 

I think that we should all stick to the same IDE in order to keep work in sync so I'd advise everyone download the Android Studio SDK from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html  
For now I would have a look at the Android tutorials at: http://developer.android.com/training/index.html  

Don't forget to comment your code and to have fun learning android!
